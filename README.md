# MCP Security Tester

A transparent security proxy that sits between your AI agent and MCP servers — watching every tool call, scanning every response, and alerting when something goes wrong.

---

## The problem

MCP servers can behave maliciously in ways that are invisible to the user:
- A server changes its tool definitions after you approved it (**rug pull**)
- A tool returns a response containing hidden instructions that hijack the agent (**prompt injection**)
- A passive tool description silently alters how the agent uses another server (**tool shadowing**)
- An agent starts calling tools it was never asked to call (**behavioral anomaly**)

None of these are detectable by reading the manifest once at install time. They require continuous runtime observation.

---

## How it works

The proxy sits transparently in the MCP communication path:

```
Agent (Cursor / Claude Desktop / Copilot)
              ↓
    mcp-security-proxy          ← intercepts every message
              ↓
      Real MCP Server(s)
```

The agent thinks it's talking directly to the real server. Every tool call flows through the proxy, which:

1. **Snapshots the manifest** on connect — diffs on every re-fetch to detect rug pulls
2. **Scans every tool output** before the agent sees it — detects injection payloads and credential leakage
3. **Logs every tool call** with full context — tool name, arguments, response, timing
4. **Flags anomalous sequences** — agent calling tools it shouldn't given the conversation context

---

## Quick start

Update your Claude Desktop / Cursor MCP config to route through the proxy:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "mcp-tester",
      "args": ["monitor", "--name", "filesystem", "--server", "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem ."]
    }
  }
}
```

Alerts stream to stderr in real time. Tool calls are logged to `mcp-security.jsonl`.

## Attack coverage

| Attack | How it's caught |
|--------|----------------|
| Tool poisoning | Static scan of manifest at connect time |
| Rug pull | Manifest diff on every re-fetch |
| Indirect prompt injection | Output scanner on every tool response |
| Tool shadowing | Cross-tool reference detection in manifest |
| Behavioral anomaly | Suspicious tool call sequence detection |

See [docs/attacks.md](docs/attacks.md) for payloads and detection logic.
